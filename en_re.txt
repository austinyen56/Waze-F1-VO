re_firstlap_10.ogg : okay no the great start let's get back on track
re_firstlap_11.ogg : that was a bad stuff but don't overreact we can salvage this
re_firstlap_12.ogg : we were looking for but it's not over yet stayfocusd
re_fit_alt_01.ogg : window is open we need you to put this lap and fit the alternative compound fit the alternative compound they stopped be disqualified
re_fit_alt_02.ogg : the pit crew will be ready for you at the end of this lap we need you to fit the alternative compound this time or will be disqualified
re_flv_cir_aut_01.ogg : to really flowing circuit are lots of medium-speed corners and changes in topography they can make them challenging work on finding a line you like and make sure you're comfortable with your Trail braking both will be useful to get here
re_flv_cir_aut_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at two and three will be the first one to give you trouble you hit the top of an incline and it's a deceptively tight corner with a late Apex it could be hard to get good traction down if you're struggling carry a bit of extra entry speed and use a bit of the runoff
re_flv_cir_aut_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk mind your loins with the last time does a T5 and T6 it's quite bumpy on the entry to both of those and it's easy to get coaltown drum wide if you aren't paying attention
re_flv_cir_aze_01.ogg : okay here's something to consider about backing take extra care of the right handwritten full and the left at 8 that takes you uphill both of these are tight Corners with deceptive runoffs it's very easy to miss your Breaking Point
re_flv_cir_aze_02.ogg : let's chat about getting around here it's a short run to someone on the first lap but the main straight is very long so keep that in mind as you coming over the grid as soon as you cross the line you're very close to the breaking point keep it neat and tidy around here as the walls aren't going to be very accommodating
re_flv_cir_bah_01.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk the temperatures may be lower than they were a few years ago thanks to the new stunt time but this is still in the desert is going to come and go as son gets blown onto the track surface and you'll cooling systems going to get a big clogged up mind the brakes in particular they'll probably be the first to suffer
re_flv_cir_bah_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at turns 9 and 10 all very tricky ignore nine almost entirely stay in the middle and take it straight so that you'll set up for 10 if it could be problems remember that Oliver exit speed out of 10 don't try and carry too much momentum into the Apex as you'll just under stare off into the sun
re_flv_cir_bah_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk break 1994 14 it's a long run from that down the pit straight so you need a good exit but you can also carry a fair amount of Entry speed so get off the brakes early and turn in a bit sooner than seems natural that, should understand pumps the Apex enough so that you can run out to the curb and get away with it
re_flv_cir_bel_01.ogg : attempting to go for very low downforce here at spa with those two long straights but remember this circuit also has some of the most difficult high-speed corners on the calendar so let's not push our luck
re_flv_cir_bel_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this Sukkot tonight Rivage I want to make sure you're comfortable this one as it drops away from you as you turn in it's very easy to snatch a break here or just carry too much speed and run wide show this corner plenty of respect
re_flv_cir_bel_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk huan is the double left-hander returns 11 and 12 scrub off a little speed and turning about 50 m in the corner if your right wheels just touch the outside Cub you know that it's hard to see your trajectory into the Apostle Apex at 10 so go easy on the power until you know you won't run why
re_flv_cir_bra_01.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk plenty of work to do today we're going to want to call with a positive front end and good traction to help us get in and out of the slow stuff insect it to
re_flv_cir_bra_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at there's a lot of time available and Son 6 if you got the line right it's a very fast right-hander just lift off the throttle to get a cartoon ending clip the curb and gently apply power to run at wide on the exit of 70 be ready for hard breaking into eight become maybe a bit unstable here
re_flv_cir_bra_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk there is still technically three corners out to turn 12 from cow but those are Rules full frontal for that long slow Corner stay as wide as you can into the breaking Zone and turn in early the Cub can look high so you'll be tempted to avoid it but the inside will will be unloaded so it should be fine
re_flv_cir_can_01.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this circuit will usually likes to put his little down. The car is we can here as there are some quite long straights broken up by Tai Chi canes it's a circuit that's quite rough on brakes as well so make sure you have a good feel for
re_flv_cir_can_02.ogg : it probably goes without saying but don't be too greedy on the throttle coming out to the 1010 happen it can trick you into thinking you've nailed the perfect line then you get on the power and understeer into the barrier favorite patient or take a later Apex
re_flv_cir_can_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk it's so tempting to take a lot of Cub to shorten that final chicane but I wouldn't risk it if I were you many of the best to put in the wall of Champions over the years trying just that just take a nice clean line and mine attraction on the exit
re_flv_cir_chn_01.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at it's really hard to wrestle a pulley setup car around here does anyone line through a lot of the corners and the penalty for getting it wrong is really hard stay on the racing line and gradually build up your confidence the team already to make adjustments so take your time getting a good balance in the car
re_flv_cir_chn_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk Tunes 12 or just one corner ready think of T1 as a single lung breaking zone for to as the ton tightens up before the round you get usually I'd advise you to use the width of the road but if you run wind here you're running off track tight 31 run out to the middle of the road if you come up the brakes and into to patience is key here
re_flv_cir_chn_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this circuit be careful of the double left-hander it turns nine and ten the Apex is later than you think it's possible to carry a fair amount of Entry speed through nine that'll put you against the outside curb for good nc-210 don't be too early on the power head though until you get well past the iPad
re_flv_cir_esp_01.ogg : Latino that way around here very well thanks to testing but we haven't been here in a few months so there's still a lot to learn good grip in the medium speed Corners will be vital here you're going to want a nice positive from 10 to work with
re_flv_cir_esp_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk you can carry much much more speed through 10 7 8 and 9 and you might expect get to turn into seven right and you can really find a good Rhythm through this section it's just a slight lift going into the right-hander at 9 that's why how much that's a question of Bravery being on the exit I do need to save it
re_flv_cir_esp_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at the 1415 sugar cane is going to feel slow there's no getting around it just focus on keeping that section tighty don't take too much cub and don't get greedy on the power trying to be a hero through the should came will ruin your life more often than not
re_flv_cir_fra_01.ogg : okay let's talk about this track late apexes of the name of the game here we have a bunch of deceptive Corners that leads straight into the ton and point for the next 12 and 1/2 and pretty much the whole line sector phone a bit packing so think ahead
re_flv_cir_fra_02.ogg : right here's something to remember about basic it watch out for tons 11 12 and 14 you need to take them wind and trailbreak to his l880 packs and get ready for the following Corner some of those entries may surprise you
re_flv_cir_gbr_01.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at weeping running the new layout at silverston for a few years now but we still like some extra data to help us find you in the set-up good traction out the slow Corners is more important than it used to be
re_flv_cir_gbr_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk be wary of the type section that turns 3 and 4 that's Village and the loop be willing to sacrifice some speed on the exit of 3 to get the best n4u Canon 24 it's a late Apex and absolutely careful to minimize wheel spin on the exit cuz it's been a long run through Aintree and down the Wellington Street
re_flv_cir_gbr_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at keeping the car stable through maggots and Beckett's is important remember that this entire section is building up for the last time the roof chapel and then I'll run down the hanging straight it's here where the time is won and lost so getting the exit to Beckett's correct is vital that the brakes before the left Kinks the cephalic car and make sure to take plenty of Cub then it's all about controlling the trail breaking into the iPad
re_flv_cir_hun_01.ogg : it's going to be a real test of all your skill hear the ungara ring requires real precision and commitment he got have to really trust the car to make sure you spend some time getting it set up in a way that you're happy with
re_flv_cir_hun_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this circuit if you see tuneful before turning in you've already messed up this is a blind left-hander the top of the hill while you'll be pulling about three and a half G's make sure you get a reliable reference point for the tunnel
re_flv_cir_hun_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk be patient around the t13 happen that's the penultimate corner it's very long so just hug the inside cub and don't get restless with your right foot it's oh so quiet to Slippery corner so if you do try and power out to earlier start to understand and struggle for traction
re_flv_cir_ita_01.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at top speed is absolutely vital here there are so many long straights that we want to run it slow it down for set up as we can get away with nailing your breaking point and getting out of Attraction zones properly going to be k
re_flv_cir_ita_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk the chicane it turns four and five is the very untied that I don't you on the side of breaking early rather than risk breaking too late you might lose a bit of speed braking too soon but as long as you're on the right line it won't be too bad break too late though and you'll miss the first Apex in tightly and lose momentum all the way down to the last mode
re_flv_cir_ita_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at the right-hander of ton6 is the first lesmo you can carry a reasonable amount of Entry speed here and can also get back on the power quite early the Campbell gives the car a lot of great so you can take an early Apex just be careful not to get too greedy you lose a lot of time if you dip a wheel of the road
re_flv_cir_jpn_01.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at Suzuka requires finding a really good Rhythm like me tricky to find through the high-speed section so getting plenty of laps that you're competent when it comes to the right
re_flv_cir_jpn_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk yeses of some of the most fun you'll have all season if you can only take a nice early turn into three which will set you up nicely for the next sequence of Corners take care with your throttle control through this section he's off if you start to drift wide and Akash and tuck back in
re_flv_cir_jpn_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at it can be easy to look up going into the tunnel Evan happen make sure you he's off the power coming through 10 if you're flat out that account will be unsettled as you get on the brakes and that's what causes the brakes to lock try to keep will spend down as you exit if you can
re_flv_cir_kor_01.ogg : a lot of medium-speed Corners to do with hair the end of a couple of very long straights make sure you have a good enough top speed in the setup or you'll be a Sitting Duck in the rice
re_flv_cir_kor_02.ogg : sequence 3 tons for 5 and 6 means you may have to sacrifice the exit of the first two to get the best possible line through 6 that's when most of the time will be won or lost in that section
re_flv_cir_kor_03.ogg : 1015 has a later Apex and you might first think it's pretty easy to run white here so be careful if you mess up 15 that'll compromise your speed through 16 17 18 and then all the way down the pit straight
re_flv_cir_mal_01.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk going to take awhile for the track to rubber in assuming it doesn't tool heavy rains very common in this climate so the truck is clean quite often we need to be prepared for all types of running so let's try number of different setup
re_flv_cir_mal_02.ogg : speed Corners at the circuit punctuated by a few slow traction zones A+ front-end is vital here especially into the tight left-hander it 29 what she will spend as you exit out the hill that the circuit will really chew through the tires if we on cap
re_flv_cir_mal_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at it's important to be wary of the entry 214 the right time to before the penultimate straight to very late Apex so you'll need to drift wind on Entry as you break if you're struggling it's better to States Heights The Run wind is very little grip over the outside Cubs
re_flv_cir_mex_01.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk everything here is completely new to us the last time an F1 car race this circuit was in 1992 Mansfield on that one but we're going to need new data so get as many laps in as you can
re_flv_cir_mex_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at be careful going into town find a lifetime the roof or is quite shallow so you might find a car is a bit unsteady at speed which could cause the brakes to lock if you try to slow down
re_flv_cir_mex_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk make sure you are comfortable with the line through the s's it's a long sequence of Corners that require careful throttle-control in a very precise line
re_flv_cir_mon_01.ogg : driving here is going to be a real test not only of your skill but also your discipline even on the conservative lap those barriers and never more than a few inches away take a single Liberty and you'll be in them so focus on getting into a consistent Rhythm it's confidence first speed second round here okay
re_flv_cir_mon_02.ogg : I'm just going to warn you now Lowe's happen is nothing overtaking opportunity unless you're leading you're probably going to be tempted to try up being selling on that one that's a good way to lose a wing you can barely get a car around that single file so don't cause an accident that okay
re_flv_cir_mon_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk to back his the very first very scary left-hand that after the new voucher cane and it has quite an early turning to take it as Speedy afternoon to scrape the barrier and the car should understand just passed it once you miss the Bay Area hot on the power just be careful not to overdo it and click the outside wall on the exit
re_flv_cir_nur_01.ogg : are a couple of tricky breaking zones here so make sure you get your reference points just right
re_flv_cir_nur_02.ogg : San Juan is very tight so be careful with the breaking the next tricky one is T3 which is a slow left-hander you'll have to compromise the exit here to make sure you get a good run through 4
re_flv_cir_nur_03.ogg : Drake nice for the ton 14 and 15 chicane starting tonight and it's easy to get misled by The Escape Road just try to keep it clean here and don't bounce the car up too much
re_flv_cir_rus_01.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk we've done plenty of simulator running here but nothing beats realdata it's not a familiar circuit so we wanted to get as many laps as you can on the about
re_flv_cir_rus_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at ignore turn one it's flat-out as far as you're concerned it doesn't really exist you'll be traveling at high speed maybe with DRS when you reach the breaking zone for to make sure you don't look up and skip the chicane
re_flv_cir_rus_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk 10-3 is the only really challenging Corner hair super long 180-degree Corner that tightens as it goes on the car will be on the edge of grip here but you must keep it tucked into the left if you let it run why do you have a horrible entry to T4 soulift a bit if you start to feel you understand
re_flv_cir_sgp_01.ogg : to tell you to make sure you find a comfortable bright balance in this session this circuit is very hard on the brakes there's a lot of time to be won and lost going into those low corners
re_flv_cir_sgp_02.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this Sukkot 2017 is the favorite spot for overtaking take an ice warning entry into find don't take too much cup if you'll risk lifting the front and understeering it's flat-out true 6 and then holding the brakes for 7 it'll be very bumpy in the offline
re_flv_cir_sgp_03.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk going under the grandstand it to an 18 is a dangerous one don't be over I'm fishes with entry speed here it's all too easy to slide wide and into the barrier you can say quite a bit of Cub on the inside boat to find an extra 10.
re_flv_cir_uae_01.ogg : we want to really optimize on the top speed in mechanical grip here yes Marina circuit has two long straights and lots of low-speed Corners it gets very technical going under the hotel so make sure you're happy with the front grill
re_flv_cir_uae_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk decathlon the approach to the right-hander at 17 you come through 16 Full Throttle to the cock and still be a bit unsettled as you coming to the breaking Zone you don't snatch a break and run wide if you can help it
re_flv_cir_uae_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this circuit it's quite a late Apex on the left corner make sure you don't cut across the Cub on the pitlane entry you can roam wineteer without losing too much time if necessary but there is less grip out there so don't rely on the runoff
re_flv_cir_usa_01.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at this bit of everything here some fun stuff insect Awana nice Longstrike insect it too and it gets a bit tight and twisty insect 23 there's a lot of change in elevation as well so make sure you get a setup you're comfortable with
re_flv_cir_usa_02.ogg : okay let's talk about this trunk it's quite a late-breaking to someone because it's uphill there are a couple of lines through here so if you a side-by-side with someone going in there you can be a bit creative just trying to make sure you have the inside 42
re_flv_cir_usa_03.ogg : okay here's something to remember about this suck at 10 16 17 and 18 of basically just one long corner it's really easy to understand here so try to feel for the grip and control the throttle you have three Apex is here and the break-ins on 419 is very close to the 18 exit so because
re_flv_enc_Q_01.ogg : what a laptop was absolutely fantastic I can hardly believe the speed you carry through some of those Corners one for the Scrapbook
re_flv_enc_R_01.ogg : come on man you can do it in a tough race but I know you're capable of getting more of that car today dig deep gives the best of your time
re_flv_ers_01.ogg : okay update on the news for you the problem is a pressure drop in the tub of which were going to try and solve with different system settings for now just dry place out

re_flv_fakeprob_02.ogg : okay so all about tire pressure data is reading zero at the moment assuming they still looking plated to you we're going to guess it's just a bad sensor shouldn't be anything to worry about
re_flv_fuel_fl_01.ogg : just a reminder we all critical on fuel probably Aleppo so short we don't need to risk a dnf chasing records so think about going down to mix 1 and lifting early into the corner
re_flv_gb_01.ogg : right we've looked at the key box issue but I'm afraid there's nothing we can do try and drive around it will just have to hope for the best remember that you have a lot of talk in the power unit so you should be able to stay in higher gears for a lot of the line
re_flv_gb_02.ogg : can I find news on the gearbox Fatima trying everything they can think of but then optimistic just keep at it through your best that's all we can ask
re_flv_prep_03.ogg : okay remember that the way the car handles is all about weight transfer when you break the center of mass moves forward when you accelerate it moves real wood and when you turn it is pushed to the outside of the car more load on each time equals more grip to make sure you're smooth for the controls to prevent the white transfer from becoming tooth Island
re_flv_prep_05.ogg : if you start to suffer from over stick come in and let us have a look at the setup you will get over stair if the rear tires lose grip before the front usually this will be coming from a lack of red downforce or an overly stiffer suspension for the little tweak with negative camber or Towing can also help with this
re_flv_prep_06.ogg : if you find yourself getting understand then you'll not getting enough grip from the front tires it could mean that the car isn't being allowed to lean on the tire possibly caused by a front suspension that's too stiff or maybe the front Wing isn't producing enough downforce
re_flv_prep_07.ogg : if you need to find small-time remember that corner exit is more important than Corner entry slowing fast and smooth on the power

re_wetness_dryint_01.ogg : okay be careful no slicks these conditions are making the line a big greasy but we're still nowhere near the changeover point
re_wetness_dryint_02.ogg : let's be mindful of the conditions the track is getting wetter recommend you stay out for now though we'll be much slower if we move on to into space
re_wetness_dryint_03.ogg : I know these conditions are tough but bad with it I don't think the truck is ready for intermediate
re_wetness_dryint_04.ogg : okay even though I seen Khan struggling these conditions if we picked printed now we're going to be too slow and we'll burn them out make the best of it for the time being
re_wetness_dryint_05.ogg : alright we're getting very close to the crossover point now stands if you have the pace but as soon as he hit the limit come and put the antennas on
re_wetness_dryint_06.ogg : Tony situation is pretty touch-and-go right now we think the Slicks may still be quicker but it's very close and you're going to struggle to keep them in the temperature window the Insiders already when you need
re_wetness_dryint_07.ogg : okay we definitely think the intermediates on the way to go now when seeing standing won't run the track and I don't see it drawing at anytime soon
re_wetness_dryint_08.ogg : sing puddles now and the joint isn't capable of moving that will try the way looks like we're around the crossover point for the intermediate
re_wetness_gen_01.ogg : I think we're still in the right times for the time
re_wetness_gen_02.ogg : we're still happy that we're on the right size of the Moon
re_wetness_gen_03.ogg : it's not a perfect situation but I don't think we have caused to move on to a different tire yet
re_wetness_gen_04.ogg : situation is an interesting one but I think the right call is to stick with what we got right now
re_wetness_gen_05.ogg : okay I think it might be just about time to come and change these time
re_wetness_gen_06.ogg : no longer sure that these times are the right ones in might be time to come in and change
re_wetness_gen_07.ogg : it's borderline but if I were you I'd come in and change ties I'm just not sure we're on the right ones for the conditions anymore
re_wetness_gen_08.ogg : looks like it's probably about time we change tires it's a bit of a crossover. For sure but the longer we stay out the worse it's going to be
re_wetness_intdry_01.ogg : the track is drawing but it's going to take awhile to clear the standing water off the line don't start thinking about slicks just yet
re_wetness_intdry_02.ogg : okay the weather suddenly he's don't for the time being but we've still got a lot of standing water out there we're happy for you to stay on the into Spanish
re_wetness_intdry_03.ogg : okay looks like some of those puddles of clearing we still on the right time for the time being but we're not a million miles away from slick conditions
re_wetness_intdry_04.ogg : I don't think the line is really drunk enough yet to stop thinking about snakes let's hold onto being this for a while longer
re_wetness_intdry_05.ogg : okay could be a risk with the circuit this greasy but we think the Slick might now be the quickest time if you think you can keep it on the road let's consider swapping over
re_wetness_intdry_06.ogg : alright consensus in the garage is that it's probably about time for these licked I know it will be slippery but it will probably be quick
re_wetness_intwet_01.ogg : you coping okay in this weather we're watching the amount of standing water on the road for now we think it's safe to stay Within
re_wetness_intwet_02.ogg : I know these conditions look pretty terrible but that water is draining away I think the intermediate is going to stay the tire of choice for a while yet
re_wetness_intwet_03.ogg : we're reaching the point where you're going to start aquaplaning with those ties we think you were right for now but it might not be long before we switch to the full wax
re_wetness_intwet_04.ogg : definitely taking up a lot of spray at this point I don't what quite ready for the full wet but we're not far off
re_wetness_intwet_05.ogg : okay I think it's about time for the full wax don't you some of those puzzles getting a bit
re_wetness_intwet_06.ogg : we've seen a couple of moments from other cars in the last-lap also the intermediate I definitely starting to struggle might be time to move on to the food web
re_wetness_wetint_01.ogg : I know what clearing the loss of water but let's stick with this time for the time being we're just asking to be spun off if we move on to the interest
re_wetness_wetint_02.ogg : well the truck is definitely drawing ants but I think we go to wall yet until it's enough to switch Tire compound
re_wetness_wetint_03.ogg : seasick it's definitely looking better than it was a few minutes ago if we could just move a bit more of that standing water we might be able to get onto the intermediate
re_wetness_wetint_04.ogg : I definitely think we need to stay on this time a bit longer but there's no question that the track is drawing we might be in a position to change the
re_wetness_wetint_05.ogg : okay I reckon we could probably get away with intermediate tires now you're going to find it harder and harder to keep the wet school from here but the entire should be easier
re_wetness_wetint_06.ogg : it could be time to come in for a fresh set of boots we're seeing a lot less pray at this point and opinion on the wall is that will probably be okay on intermediate
re_wet_s_out_01.ogg : we've only got a few laps left we could risk staying out on the dry tires and ice it becomes undrivable
re_wet_s_out_02.ogg : there's not much left in this we could trim remain on the drive tires and ice it becomes I'm driving
