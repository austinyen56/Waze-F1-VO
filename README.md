Custom Waze apk file that contains voice from F1 2020 (Jeff)

## How to download and install this program

* Go to [Releases](https://github.com/austinyen56/Waze-F1-VO/releases/) and click on the apk file to download
* After downloading the apk file, go to the Google Play store and download [Apk-signer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.haibison.apksigner&hl=en&gl=US)
* Load the apk file into apk-signer and install it 
* Open and log in to Waze and have fun :)  Note: (might not work if you are using guest user)

## Small issues/ things to note about in the apk file

* Try not to change the voice language. You can still change the waze app language whatever you like
* Sounds are set to announce distance in miles
* All of the sound files are extracted from the F1 2020 game. I had to piece some phrases together manually which may cause the output to be a bit choppy

Due to phrases not being present (or resulted in extreme choppyness) in the game, here are some phrase changes to the sound files:
* At the roundabout &rarr; At the end of the following corners
* Take the x exit &rarr; Take the x pit window
* Make a U turn &rarr; Turn 180 degree
* Police reported ahead &rarr; Safety car deployed, no overtaking, reduce your pace
* Red light warning &rarr; The radar suggests that they seem to have a red camera ahead
